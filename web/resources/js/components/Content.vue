      <h2>Who am i?</h2>
      <h5>My name is Tom. As you might have guessed; With 10+ years experience, i've worked across multiple disciplines in multiple countries &amp; cities. My focus has been to develop web &amp; mobile applications, while providing solid & robust software archictecture using modern tools &amp; best practices. I develop primarily using a LEMP stack and lean toward frameworks like Slim (this website), Laravel, VueJS &amp; others.</h5>
      <h5>It remains my focus, to provide end-to-end integration, from planning & design, through to development &amp; release.</h5>
